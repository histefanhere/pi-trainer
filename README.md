# π Trainer
Congratulations on wanting to learn the mysterious digits of π! A truley exciting journey awaits you.

Pi trainer is a simple website for praciticing your Pi memory skills. It was made with beauty and minimalism in mind, without sacrificing on functionality.

## How to use Pi trainer
When you open Pi trainer, you'll see the digit *three*, followed by a *decimal point.* That's the start of Pi, and the rest is up to you - simply go ahead and start typing!

If you make a mistake the screen will flash red to notify you, and your *errors* score will increase - try to keep it as low as possible (but don't worry if you get some miss-clicks, typing perfectly is *very* hard). Keep an eye out on your *percentage,* which tracks what percentage of your presses are correct.
