# π Trainer
Congratulations on wanting to learn the mysterious digits of π! A truley exciting journey awaits you.

Pi trainer is a simple website for praciticing your Pi skills. It has minimalism in mind, yet still functional.

## How to use the π trainer
When you open up the Pi traner, you'll see the digit *three*, followed by a *decimal point.* That's the start of Pi, and the rest is up to you - simply go ahead and start typing!

If you make a mistake the screen will flash red to notify you, and your *errors* score will increase. Keep an eye out on your *percentage,* and try to keep it as low as possible (but don't worry if you get some errors, typing perfectly is very hard).

A copy of the pi trainer is running live at [http://www.histefanhere.com/pi](http://www.histefanhere.com/pi). Go ahead and check it out.
